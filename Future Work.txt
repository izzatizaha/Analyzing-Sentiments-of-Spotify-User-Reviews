Future Work

There are several potential avenues for future work. One approach is to enhance the performance of machine learning models by exploring more advanced techniques like Gradient Boosting Machines or deep learning models such as LSTMs. 
Additionally, improving existing models through hyperparameter tuning or ensemble methods could lead to higher accuracy. Another area to investigate is refining the sentiment analysis process by implementing a more detailed classification system, 
such as sentiment intensity scoring, rather than simply categorizing reviews into Good, Neutral, and Bad. Lastly, broadening the dataset by including reviews from other platforms, like the App Store or social media, 
could help improve the model's generalizability.
